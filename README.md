# RWAkins — AI CFO Agent on Mantle

RWAkins is a Personal CFO agent that removes the complexity of real-world asset investing. Instead of manually configuring sliders and monitoring markets, users simply describe their financial goals in a chat interface. The AI agent continuously evaluates live market data against the user's stated wealth rules and autonomously executes on-chain rebalances between two yield-bearing assets:

- **USDY** — Ondo's tokenized US Treasury bonds. The stable, low-risk leg.
- **mETH** — Mantle Staked ETH. The growth, higher-yield leg.

Yields and prices are **not hardcoded** — they are pulled live and synced on-chain (see *Live & Dynamic* below).

---

## Live & Dynamic — nothing hardcoded

Every number the agent reasons over and shows is sourced live; the on-chain state is kept in sync with the real market by the agent itself.

| System | How it's live |
|---|---|
| **Wealth-rule parsing** | An LLM (Groq, OpenAI-compatible) extracts *signals* from your plain-English goal; a deterministic priority-chain turns them into the allocation. No-key fallback is a regex parser. |
| **Real DEX swaps** | Every rebalance is a **real on-chain swap** through `RWAkinsAMM` — a constant-product (x·y=k) pool with a 0.3% fee ([contracts/src/RWAkinsAMM.sol](contracts/src/RWAkinsAMM.sol)). The vault routes USDY↔mETH through it, so rebalances take **real slippage + price impact** (a 70% target lands at ~69.96%, not a clean number). No mint-at-fixed-price. |
| **mETH price** | The pool's **on-chain spot price** (`reserveUsdy/reserveMeth`) — real price discovery. The agent owner key anchors it to the live CoinGecko price via `amm.syncToPrice()` ([lib/rwa/oracleSync.ts](lib/rwa/oracleSync.ts)), exactly the job arbitrageurs do on a real DEX. The dashboard reads the pool price back, so `$` and `%` reconcile. |
| **USDY & mETH yields** | Real reference APYs from DefiLlama, written on-chain via `token.setYield()` each sync; the dashboard reads `currentYield()`. |
| **Volatility** | Annualized **realized volatility** computed from CoinGecko's 7-day hourly ETH series ([lib/api/coingecko.ts](lib/api/coingecko.ts)) — not a formula. |
| **Risk council** | 4 agents (Market Analyst, Risk Guardian, Yield Optimizer, Execution Planner) are **real LLM personas** debating the live numbers ([lib/aiCouncil/council.ts](lib/aiCouncil/council.ts)). The mETH ≤ 70% cap veto is enforced in code, never delegated to the model. Deterministic per-agent fallback when the LLM is unavailable. |
| **Execution** | Real `vault.rebalance()` / `rebalanceFor()` on Mantle Sepolia → real tx hashes + real AMM swaps. Gas-gated oracle writes only fire when the live value actually drifted. |

> **On the assets:** USDY/mETH are deployed as testnet `MockRWAToken` contracts (real Ondo USDY / Mantle mETH are mainnet-only + KYC-gated). The **swap mechanics, price discovery, yields, and volatility are all real** — only the tokens are stand-ins. Mainnet is an address swap (real USDY/mETH + a real Mantle DEX router) plus Ondo KYC away; the agent/vault logic is unchanged.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Foundry (for contract deployment)
- A funded Mantle Sepolia wallet (get MNT from the [Mantle faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.mantle.xyz))

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/rwakins
cd rwakins
npm install
```

### 2. Set environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=        # funded Mantle Sepolia key — never commit this
METH_PRICE_USD=3000          # initial mETH/USDY price
```

### 3. Deploy contracts

```bash
cd hub
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url mantle_sepolia \
  --broadcast
```

This deploys the full stack to Mantle Sepolia — the two `MockRWAToken`s (USDY, mETH), `RWAkinsAMM`, `RWAkinsVault`, plus the **AI × RWA credit suite**: `RWAkinsCompliance`, `RWAkinsCreditPassport`, and `RWAkinsLending`. All addresses are written to `lib/rwa-deployed.json` automatically, and the pages flip from "Preview · deploy pending" to "Live on Mantle" the moment they're populated.

> **Privileged writes (KYC attestation, credit scoring, risk anchoring, audit logging)** are signed server-side by the verifier/agent key. Set `AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` to the **deploy key** (the script sets it as the on-chain `attestor` + `agent` + `scorer`). Without it the suite still computes real AI scores over live data and degrades to a decision-only response with `txHash: null` — it never fabricates a hash.

---

## The AI × RWA credit suite

The vault is one half of an end-to-end on-chain credit loop. **Earn → build reputation → borrow**, every step KYC-gated, risk-scored, and recorded on Mantle:

| Tool | Route | What's real on-chain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compliance** | `/compliance` | KYC tier + jurisdiction attested on-chain (`RWAkinsCompliance.attestKYC`); self-sovereign investment mandate; a hard-gate AI compliance check whose verdict is appended to the audit trail. Sanctioned-jurisdiction + KYC gates are enforced in **code**, never by the model. |
| **Audit Trail** | `/compliance/audit-trail` | A tamper-evident, per-wallet monotonic log of every agent decision + risk score, read straight from contract events — each linked to its Mantle tx. |
| **AI Risk System** | `/insurance-risk-system` | A 5-dimension risk score (concentration, market/vol, liquidity, leverage, yield sustainability), computed deterministically and **anchored on-chain** via `recordRisk`. |
| **Credit Passport** | `/credit` | A **soulbound (non-transferable) ERC-721** carrying a 300-900 credit score the AI engine computes from real on-chain behaviour. |
| **AI Lending** | `/lend` | Borrow USDY against USDY/mETH. The AI negotiates the APR; the **credit passport score sets the LTV**; `RWAkinsCompliance.isVerified()` is enforced on-chain before any loan opens. |

Engines are pure + auditable (`lib/creditSuite/*`, "signal-then-code" like the rebalance brain); the AI overlay (`/api/{compliance,risk,credit,lend}/*`) adds natural-language judgement but never moves a hard gate.

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and connect your wallet on Mantle Testnet.

---

## How to Use

1. **Connect** your MetaMask wallet on Mantle Sepolia Testnet
2. **Describe** your financial goals in the chat — plain English, no sliders
3. **Confirm** the AI CFO's parsed allocation plan
4. **Fund** the vault — the agent mints test USDY to your wallet and deposits it
5. **Run Rebalance** — the agent evaluates market conditions and executes on-chain
6. **View Activity** — every decision with its reason and Mantle tx hash
